                      I18N-Charset Distribution

This distribution contains a module which maps Character Set names to
the names officially registered with IANA.

    I18N::Charset
	For example, 'Shift_JIS' is the official name of 'x-sjis'.

To install these modules, you should just have to run the following:

	% perl Makefile.PL
	% make
	% make test
	% make install

The module is documented using pod. When you "make install", you
will get a man page I18N::Charset

Please let me know if you experience any problems with this module,
or have any ideas for additions.
